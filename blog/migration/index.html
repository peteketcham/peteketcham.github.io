My team was responsible for supporting the production and QA environments for applications servicing the accounting and tax markets. Typically, our role would involve onboarding, releases, building of new servers and environments,
decommissioning of old servers, applications, and environments, setting
up of monitoring and the overall lifecycle of the application. We would
serve as a liaison between the development and DevOps teams and the
datacenter services teams (e.g., OS management, database, networking,
etc.).</p><h2 id=the-project>The Project</h2><p>One of the applications we were tasked with onboarding while I was with
HC was a product suite I&rsquo;m going to refer to as OTP. This was a new
product category for the company and industry, due to
new financial regulations a few years earlier. The acquiured business was about 4
years old at this point and they were running out of a managed services
3rd party datacenter. I was tasked with the planning and orchestration
of the move into a company owned and managed datacenter.</p><p>This business was a suite of several different products:</p><ul><li><p>OTP &ndash; &ldquo;One Tax Product&rdquo;, the flagship application.</p></li><li><p>Mini-OTP &ndash; Barebones version of OTP intended for data entry for
limited users.</p></li><li><p>UTP &ndash; &ldquo;Uther[sp.] Tax Product&rdquo;, began as a rewrite of OTP as a
web-based application, but was transitioned into a wholly new
product offering halfway through development.</p></li><li><p>OXTP &ndash; &ldquo;Other Cross Tax Product&rdquo;, custom app for a single customer
that became a wholly new product offering.</p></li></ul><p>Due to some contractual obligations, these apps were running multiple
different versions of each product in production for different subsets
of customers. For example, OTP and Mini-OTP were running around two
dozen different versions of code across 4 years of releases, and UTP and
OXTP were running 4-6 versions each. These apps were not architected in similar
ways&mdash;OTP and OXTP were Windows desktop applications that were running
in a VDI farm (one with an Oracle DB backend, and the other with
MSSQL, and OTP had additional functionality on webservers accessed
through a web frame within the application), Mini-OTP was a minimal
subset of OTP functionality running in a Tomcat instance across Linux
servers (and sharing the OTP database), UTP was a Tomcat application
that had custom Java daemon helper processes for managing data (e.g.,
ETL) into a MongoDB database for reports in addition to an Oracle DB for
customer data.</p><h2 id=the-setup>The Setup</h2><p>When I was brought on to help drive this migration, most of the
institutional knowledge for the applications had already left the
company&mdash;the entire DevOps team had quit, as well as several key
developers. Several groups of leadership from the datacenter operations
business unit had been out to their remote office in New Jersey to try
and build a relationship but all their interactions were still very
acrimonious. There were regularly heated arguments over any and every
attempt to find common ground and to plan out what their application
migration would look like, and no progress had been made yet. With that
history in mind, I was flown out to their office to build a relationship
with the former call center staff that had been appointed to take over
for the DevOps team, integrate them into my application support team,
and to start building out knowledge of the applications and operations
to make any sort of headway into supporting their business.</p><p>On the first day I was in their office, I met with the teams and started
to sit down and work through what information and runbooks were
available and to start to get a general lay of the land. That afternoon,
while working through the application&rsquo;s architectures, we were
interrupted by another member of the call center staff that the UTP
application had gone down and they were unable to get it back up and
running. I took the opportunity to take what they&rsquo;d done so far, what
the error messages were, and start walking through the architecture with
them to track down the problem.</p><p><img src=migration/utp-arch.svg alt="UTP Architecture Diagram"></p><p>Walking through it step by step, they guided me to quickly draw up the
applications functions on a whiteboard and how work flowed through the
system. We quickly found that:</p><ul><li><p>They had no errors on the web tier of the application</p></li><li><p>The ETL processes were throwing error messages across all parts of
the process and all versions</p><ul><li>The errors persisted through a service restart</li></ul></li><li><p>MongoDB was showing no errors</p></li><li><p>The Oracle DB was showing no errors</p><ul><li>They were able to verify that transactions involving the DB were
completing successfully.</li></ul></li></ul><p>As we mapped it out how these pieces fit together, I was able to point
out to the team that while MongoDB was not giving any errors, that was
the only common piece across all the error messages being presented and
asked what steps can we take to verify its health? It came out that
there was no knowledge on what it did or why it was there. It was
implemented by a now-former developer as part of the ETL reporting
process. I asked to check out the server directly and quickly discovered
that the filesystem had filled up&mdash;reports were being generated, loaded
into MongoDB, passed on to the next step, but never cleaned out of the
queue. With no one having any knowledge of how to manage MongoDB, I
quickly found a stop gap solution to clear out the database&mdash;clear out
all documents older than today&rsquo;s date. After verifying that data-loss in
this piece was acceptable since the documents were only used in a
temporary fashion, I ran the commands to clear up space and we were able
to get the application up and running again. After a few hours
monitoring the disk space on the server, we were able to verify that the
rate growth meant it would be months before the issue would recur and
were able to put bug fix request in the developer&rsquo;s queue to remedy.</p><p>This ended up being the spark to build a positive relationship with the
business. They had been so slammed with day-to-day issues like this and
weren&rsquo;t sharing that these were happening that it hadn&rsquo;t been
communicated clearly that I (and my team) were there to help them as
their partners to help solve these problems with the applications and
ultimately make the business more stable and reliable. I spent the rest
of the next two weeks in the office with them going over all the
applications and their many parts in as much detail as we could fit in
and was able to return home with far more information to work with than
any of us had before.</p><h2 id=working-the-project>Working the Project</h2><p>Returning home from my site visit, I was given a new direction and
goal&mdash;over the next 12 months, I would build out and test all the
applications in the company-owned datacenter and plan for a migration at
the end of that window. Additionally, the new DevOps team from the
business would be rolled into my existing team. I set our first
milestone&mdash;get OTP 9.20 up and running successfully (the dozens of
versions running in production varied between 5.0.x and 9.20). Over the
next 9 months, I met with the developers, the new DevOps engineers, QA
testers, and the help desk staff daily as we worked through
installation, configuration, and behaviors of the application. We&rsquo;d meet
multiple times a week with project managers and leadership from the
business as well as the datacenter operations teams to go over progress,
blocking issues, and the ongoing business of the applications (as
regular issues and releases continued to progress in parallel to the
migration). At the end of the 9 months, we reached a point where we&rsquo;d
managed to get most functionality working for that single version of
OTP, but it was becoming clear that we weren&rsquo;t going to finish within 12
months, as the remaining applications and sub-versions were far from
being up and running. I brought 4 contractors into the project at this
point to help with the workload, and the migration was pushed out for
another 9 months. I also obtained:</p><ul><li><p>A tech writer to help document runbooks, architectures, processes,
etc.</p></li><li><p>A Linux systems administrator to help with the setup,
administration, and automation for UTP and Mini-OTP</p></li><li><p>A Virtualization/Windows administrator to help with setup,
administration, and automation for the desktop app portion of OTP</p></li><li><p>A Windows administrator/generalist to help with the IIS and &lsquo;other&rsquo;
portions of the applications</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, both the business and the datacenter operations groups
dedicated a project manager to help with the orchestration&mdash;what are
our blocking issues, who else needs to be brought in, what leverage can
be applied to make certain tasks go faster, etc.</p><p><img src=migration/otp-arch.svg alt="OTP, Mini-OTP, and OXTP high-level architecture"></p><p>With more people involved in the migration, my role transitioned into a
project lead&mdash;I would find and assign tasks, assist the team with their
tasks, and dive in on tasks that were particularly complex and/or of
high priority. The large number of versions running brought up a lot of
issues with versioning of their dependencies&mdash;ODBC driver versions that
would work for some versions would work for others, and the installers
would overwrite other versions if they weren&rsquo;t applied in a specific
order. QA testing would pass on versions, and then fail in previously
undocumented ways on other servers. As part of the transition, we were
also migrating up two versions of Windows Server, and had similar issues
with .NET and it&rsquo;s required assemblies that had not been documented in
any of the application information. Every week brought new challenges to
solve for everyone involved.</p><p>As the business was an acquired startup, the applications were not
designed with scalability in mind. There were multiple issues around how
this played out, but a prominent issue was that about half of the
customers for Mini-OTP and UTP were single tenant. They would have
dozens of customers each having their own custom configured web
application (packaged into a WAR file) running in Tomcat for the
application, with hardcoded unique connection strings and other
customizations within the package. There was no artifact or
configuration management at the time, so the Linux admin contractor that
was brought on and I worked on creating a script to manage updating the
hundreds of WAR files for the migration. The script would traverse the
appropriate paths within the Tomcat installation, and with each file,
version it, find the appropriate files within the WAR and strings within
the file to update, repackage the WAR, and then force a redeploy in
Tomcat.</p><p>Work progressed at a steady pace for the next 9 months, with me and my
team deploying functions, sending them to QA to test, troubleshoot, and
worked into a regular rhythm where we would find an issue, solve an
issue, and then a new issue would be found, and the cycle would repeat.
While the Linux contractor was working through issues with Mini-OTP and
UTP, the other two sysadmin contractors were working through OTP and
OXTP, with the tech writer checking in to compile their notes and
lessons into a consistent style and voice.</p><p>Through regular conversations with the business, my team and I targeted
specific versions of code that were causing the most issues, and the
business worked with the customers to get them upgraded as much as
possible and were able to eliminate about half a dozen versions of code
(v7.x specifically had irreconcilable issues we were never able to pin
down) by migrating them to newer application versions.</p><p>During this time, we also started planning out the migration date&mdash;what
days worked with known blackouts, contacting key customers, steps and
order for the migration, what parties had steps and what they would
involve, and what criteria constituted a successful failover vs forcing
a rollback.</p><p>For the migration, several leaders from the business flew from their
office in NJ to MN, and representatives from all the parties involved in
the cutover setup in a war room at the office. We started around 9pm CT
in the evening with shutdowns and putting up offline notifications, and
began with application and database cutovers, which would take hours to
complete. Around 2am CT, key functions were up and running again, and
pieces were handed of for QA testing as they came online. We concluded
the migration at 7am CT when all key functionalities had been tested and
verified as working, and while there were issues remaining, they were
all minor enough that they could be fixed in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id=retrospective>Retrospective</h2><p>The impact of completing this project was a cost savings of over $1
million per year in hosting costs and significantly improved
uptime&mdash;from more than 24 hours of impact from infrastructure
maintenance and issues to less than an hour per year (~99.5% to 99.99%
uptime). The automation and tooling developed in the migration made
future releases go more smoothly, monitoring tools available in the new
datacenter gave better visibility into application health, and the
scrutiny from poring over the applications in such detail allowed us to
find and remedy multiple security vulnerabilities. The improved
relationship between the business and datacenter operations helped each
better anticipate the other&rsquo;s needs and opened the door for additional
integrations between OTP and other HC products.</p><p>I learned a lot about managing without influence&mdash;working with teams
and individuals that have no organizational reason to help, working with
individuals that actively don&rsquo;t want to help, and how useful it is to
approach these interactions by framing it as &lsquo;what&rsquo;s in it for them&rsquo;.
This really made me examine what it means to be a leader vs a manager,
and the example I wanted to set as a leader. The business learned to
better collaborate with outside teams and have more open and honest
communication across organizational boundaries, and the datacenter
operations team started approaching the groups as more of a
collaboration and not simply in a top-down manner.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3"><div class=sticky-sidebar><aside class=toc><h5>Table Of Contents</h5><div class=toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#the-project>The Project</a></li><li><a href=#the-setup>The Setup</a></li><li><a href=#working-the-project>Working the Project</a></li><li><a href=#retrospective>Retrospective</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside><aside class=social><h5>Social</h5><div class=social-content><ul class=list-inline><li class="list-inline-item text-center"><a target=_blank href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Rehosting&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.peteketcham.com%2fblog%2fmigration%2f"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item text-center"><a target=_blank href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Rehosting: https%3a%2f%2fwww.peteketcham.com%2fblog%2fmigration%2f"><i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item text-center"><a target=_blank href='mailto:?subject=Rehosting&body=Check%20out%20this%20site https%3a%2f%2fwww.peteketcham.com%2fblog%2fmigration%2f'><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a></li></ul></div></aside></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-9 p-4"></div></div></div><button class="p-2 px-3" onclick=topFunction() id=topScroll>
