I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get into things like LeetCode, and struggle to come up with ideas to do something new that will keep me engaged longer than a series of scripts, and came across Project Euler.
Project Euler problems are math heavy problems that you typically need to write code to solve. They start out pretty simple, but quickly get complex and weird.</description></item></channel></rss>
