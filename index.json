It was fun, and hard, and complex, and wanted to share the recipes and some background of the different things that were made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"squash-soup\"\u003eSquash Soup\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/harvest-dinner/squash.jpg\" alt=\"Squash\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180310140709/http://vegenistaskitchen.com/blue-hubbard-squash-bisque/\"\u003eSquash bisque soup!\u003c/a\u003e This was one of several giant blue hubbard squash that were grown out at the in-laws this past summer.  I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of how to eat it all before it went bad, and what better way than to serve a crowd?  I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the recipe exactly\u0026ndash; I subbed out cashew cream for heavy cream, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I still ended up light on the squash and heavy on the broth, and accidentally added the sage and thyme to the roast carrots instead of the soup, but it came out delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cornbread\"\u003eCornbread\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/harvest-dinner/cornbread.jpg\" alt=\"Cornbread\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my go-to recipe right now; I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the multiple I used to fill a pan this size\u0026ndash; 12x maybe?

My father-in-law smoked 9 briskets on the smoker\u0026ndash; had to rig them up to stand vertically to fit them all in.  The usual prep is to coat the brisket in yellow mustard, rub down with a spice rub (varies, but Meat Church has been the go-to for a while), wrap in plastic and let sit for several hours.  After that, it goes in the smoker for several more hours, then a wrap in foil, continue to cook until it gets to temperature, then a rest in a cooler for several hours before serving.
