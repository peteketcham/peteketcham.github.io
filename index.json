Typically, our role would involve onboarding, releases, building of new servers and environments,\ndecommissioning of old servers, applications, and environments, setting\nup of monitoring and the overall lifecycle of the application. We would\nserve as a liaison between the development and DevOps teams and the\ndatacenter services teams (e.g., OS management, database, networking,\netc.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-project\"\u003eThe Project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the applications we were tasked with onboarding while I was with\nHC was a product suite I\u0026rsquo;m going to refer to as OTP. This was a new\nproduct category for the company and industry, due to\nnew financial regulations a few years earlier. The acquiured business was about 4\nyears old at this point and they were running out of a managed services\n3rd party datacenter. I was tasked with the planning and orchestration\nof the move into a company owned and managed datacenter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis business was a suite of several different products:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOTP \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;One Tax Product\u0026rdquo;, the flagship application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMini-OTP \u0026ndash; Barebones version of OTP intended for data entry for\nlimited users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUTP \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Uther[sp.] Tax Product\u0026rdquo;, began as a rewrite of OTP as a\nweb-based application, but was transitioned into a wholly new\nproduct offering halfway through development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOXTP \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Other Cross Tax Product\u0026rdquo;, custom app for a single customer\nthat became a wholly new product offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to some contractual obligations, these apps were running multiple\ndifferent versions of each product in production for different subsets\nof customers. For example, OTP and Mini-OTP were running around two\ndozen different versions of code across 4 years of releases, and UTP and\nOXTP were running 4-6 versions each. These apps were not architected in similar\nways\u0026mdash;OTP and OXTP were Windows desktop applications that were running\nin a VDI farm (one with an Oracle DB backend, and the other with\nMSSQL, and OTP had additional functionality on webservers accessed\nthrough a web frame within the application), Mini-OTP was a minimal\nsubset of OTP functionality running in a Tomcat instance across Linux\nservers (and sharing the OTP database), UTP was a Tomcat application\nthat had custom Java daemon helper processes for managing data (e.g.,\nETL) into a MongoDB database for reports in addition to an Oracle DB for\ncustomer data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-setup\"\u003eThe Setup\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was brought on to help drive this migration, most of the\ninstitutional knowledge for the applications had already left the\ncompany\u0026mdash;the entire DevOps team had quit, as well as several key\ndevelopers. Several groups of leadership from the datacenter operations\nbusiness unit had been out to their remote office in New Jersey to try\nand build a relationship but all their interactions were still very\nacrimonious. There were regularly heated arguments over any and every\nattempt to find common ground and to plan out what their application\nmigration would look like, and no progress had been made yet. With that\nhistory in mind, I was flown out to their office to build a relationship\nwith the former call center staff that had been appointed to take over\nfor the DevOps team, integrate them into my application support team,\nand to start building out knowledge of the applications and operations\nto make any sort of headway into supporting their business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the first day I was in their office, I met with the teams and started\nto sit down and work through what information and runbooks were\navailable and to start to get a general lay of the land.

I took the opportunity to take what they\u0026rsquo;d done so far, what\nthe error messages were, and start walking through the architecture with\nthem to track down the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"migration/utp-arch.svg\" alt=\"UTP Architecture Diagram\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking through it step by step, they guided me to quickly draw up the\napplications functions on a whiteboard and how work flowed through the\nsystem.

It came out that\nthere was no knowledge on what it did or why it was there. It was\nimplemented by a now-former developer as part of the ETL reporting\nprocess. I asked to check out the server directly and quickly discovered\nthat the filesystem had filled up\u0026mdash;reports were being generated, loaded\ninto MongoDB, passed on to the next step, but never cleaned out of the\nqueue. With no one having any knowledge of how to manage MongoDB, I\nquickly found a stop gap solution to clear out the database\u0026mdash;clear out\nall documents older than today\u0026rsquo;s date. After verifying that data-loss in\nthis piece was acceptable since the documents were only used in a\ntemporary fashion, I ran the commands to clear up space and we were able\nto get the application up and running again. After a few hours\nmonitoring the disk space on the server, we were able to verify that the\nrate growth meant it would be months before the issue would recur and\nwere able to put bug fix request in the developer\u0026rsquo;s queue to remedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ended up being the spark to build a positive relationship with the\nbusiness.

I spent the rest\nof the next two weeks in the office with them going over all the\napplications and their many parts in as much detail as we could fit in\nand was able to return home with far more information to work with than\nany of us had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"working-the-project\"\u003eWorking the Project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning home from my site visit, I was given a new direction and\ngoal\u0026mdash;over the next 12 months, I would build out and test all the\napplications in the company-owned datacenter and plan for a migration at\nthe end of that window. Additionally, the new DevOps team from the\nbusiness would be rolled into my existing team. I set our first\nmilestone\u0026mdash;get OTP 9.20 up and running successfully (the dozens of\nversions running in production varied between 5.0.x and 9.20). Over the\nnext 9 months, I met with the developers, the new DevOps engineers, QA\ntesters, and the help desk staff daily as we worked through\ninstallation, configuration, and behaviors of the application. We\u0026rsquo;d meet\nmultiple times a week with project managers and leadership from the\nbusiness as well as the datacenter operations teams to go over progress,\nblocking issues, and the ongoing business of the applications (as\nregular issues and releases continued to progress in parallel to the\nmigration). At the end of the 9 months, we reached a point where we\u0026rsquo;d\nmanaged to get most functionality working for that single version of\nOTP, but it was becoming clear that we weren\u0026rsquo;t going to finish within 12\nmonths, as the remaining applications and sub-versions were far from\nbeing up and running. I brought 4 contractors into the project at this\npoint to help with the workload, and the migration was pushed out for\nanother 9 months.

The large number of versions running brought up a lot of\nissues with versioning of their dependencies\u0026mdash;ODBC driver versions that\nwould work for some versions would work for others, and the installers\nwould overwrite other versions if they weren\u0026rsquo;t applied in a specific\norder. QA testing would pass on versions, and then fail in previously\nundocumented ways on other servers. As part of the transition, we were\nalso migrating up two versions of Windows Server, and had similar issues\nwith .NET and it\u0026rsquo;s required assemblies that had not been documented in\nany of the application information. Every week brought new challenges to\nsolve for everyone involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the business was an acquired startup, the applications were not\ndesigned with scalability in mind. There were multiple issues around how\nthis played out, but a prominent issue was that about half of the\ncustomers for Mini-OTP and UTP were single tenant. They would have\ndozens of customers each having their own custom configured web\napplication (packaged into a WAR file) running in Tomcat for the\napplication, with hardcoded unique connection strings and other\ncustomizations within the package. There was no artifact or\nconfiguration management at the time, so the Linux admin contractor that\nwas brought on and I worked on creating a script to manage updating the\nhundreds of WAR files for the migration. The script would traverse the\nappropriate paths within the Tomcat installation, and with each file,\nversion it, find the appropriate files within the WAR and strings within\nthe file to update, repackage the WAR, and then force a redeploy in\nTomcat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork progressed at a steady pace for the next 9 months, with me and my\nteam deploying functions, sending them to QA to test, troubleshoot, and\nworked into a regular rhythm where we would find an issue, solve an\nissue, and then a new issue would be found, and the cycle would repeat.\nWhile the Linux contractor was working through issues with Mini-OTP and\nUTP, the other two sysadmin contractors were working through OTP and\nOXTP, with the tech writer checking in to compile their notes and\nlessons into a consistent style and voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough regular conversations with the business, my team and I targeted\nspecific versions of code that were causing the most issues, and the\nbusiness worked with the customers to get them upgraded as much as\npossible and were able to eliminate about half a dozen versions of code\n(v7.x specifically had irreconcilable issues we were never able to pin\ndown) by migrating them to newer application versions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, we also started planning out the migration date\u0026mdash;what\ndays worked with known blackouts, contacting key customers, steps and\norder for the migration, what parties had steps and what they would\ninvolve, and what criteria constituted a successful failover vs forcing\na rollback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the migration, several leaders from the business flew from their\noffice in NJ to MN, and representatives from all the parties involved in\nthe cutover setup in a war room at the office. We started around 9pm CT\nin the evening with shutdowns and putting up offline notifications, and\nbegan with application and database cutovers, which would take hours to\ncomplete. Around 2am CT, key functions were up and running again, and\npieces were handed of for QA testing as they came online. We concluded\nthe migration at 7am CT when all key functionalities had been tested and\nverified as working, and while there were issues remaining, they were\nall minor enough that they could be fixed in the coming weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"retrospective\"\u003eRetrospective\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of completing this project was a cost savings of over $1\nmillion per year in hosting costs and significantly improved\nuptime\u0026mdash;from more than 24 hours of impact from infrastructure\nmaintenance and issues to less than an hour per year (~99.5% to 99.99%\nuptime). The automation and tooling developed in the migration made\nfuture releases go more smoothly, monitoring tools available in the new\ndatacenter gave better visibility into application health, and the\nscrutiny from poring over the applications in such detail allowed us to\nfind and remedy multiple security vulnerabilities. The improved\nrelationship between the business and datacenter operations helped each\nbetter anticipate the other\u0026rsquo;s needs and opened the door for additional\nintegrations between OTP and other HC products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned a lot about managing without influence\u0026mdash;working with teams\nand individuals that have no organizational reason to help, working with\nindividuals that actively don\u0026rsquo;t want to help, and how useful it is to\napproach these interactions by framing it as \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo;s in it for them\u0026rsquo;.\nThis really made me examine what it means to be a leader vs a manager,\nand the example I wanted to set as a leader. The business learned to\nbetter collaborate with outside teams and have more open and honest\ncommunication across organizational boundaries, and the datacenter\noperations team started approaching the groups as more of a\ncollaboration and not simply in a top-down manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://www.peteketcham.com/blog/migration/","title":"Rehosting"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eHello World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dacpz9qg0/w_auto,c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,dpr_auto/images/cicada.jpg\" class=\"cld-responsive\" style=\"padding-bottom: 16px; display: block; margin: auto; max-width:80%\"\u003e\n\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://www.peteketcham.com/blog/my-first-post/","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://www.peteketcham.com/search/","title":"Search"}]
